# [GetCultured](https://getcultured.herokuapp.com/) (RoR Microverse Capstone Project)

## GetCultured is a lifestyle blog site where people all over the world can view, like, and write articles about their culture, food, lifestyle, etc.

## Project Description 

#### In this project, I designed my own online lifestyle publication with this [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version) as a reference. 

#### This sleek and modern website was built with a mobile-first approach, while applying fluid design principles. It is fully-responsive across all screen sizes - mobile, tablet, and desktop. Here, users can sign up, log in, write articles with multiple categories, and like other articles.


#### The purpose of this project was to demonstrate mastery of Ruby and RoR fundamentals. It has the following features:
- Uses MVP architectural pattern, with RESTFUL routes configured
- Utilizes controllers to intercept user requests, following Rails CRUD best practices/conventions
- Uses scopes and helpers to keep clode clean
- Uses view templates for HTML with embedded data
- Connected to Postgres Database and Active Storage for image attachments
- Has ActiveRecord validations and authentication via Devise
- Avoids n+1 queries problem
- Contains unit tests (Rspec)
- Deployed on Heroku
